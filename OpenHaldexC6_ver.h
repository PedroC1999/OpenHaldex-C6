Version Control:

*** remember and update FW_VERSION in '_defs.h' ***

V1.00.0 - basic code for testing
V1.01.0 - added in reliable mode changing and eeprom saving
V1.02.0 - confirmed Gen1 (OEM & Standalone), Gen4 (Standalone)
V1.03.0 - confirmed Gen2, updated general codebase
V1.04.0 - added feedback for incoming brake/handbrake sensors.  Added options to invert if required
V1.05.0 - brake out GPIO mapped incorrectly - changed
V1.06.0 - added 6040 split
V1.07.0 - added OTA updates (!) Thanks to Sasha!
V1.08.0 - Sorted crash when long press / WiFi reset
V1.09.0 - revised throttle AND speed setpoints to work together with enable/disable lock - thanks to Chris!
V1.10.0 - added custom mode to allow custom lock percentage (based on speed/throttle/body)
V1.11.0 - added SavvyCAN

V2.00.0 - changed to PlatformIO / VS Code
V2.01.0 - added custom UI with:
        > 'on TC, enable 5050' checkbox & 'on ext. button hold, enable 5050' checkbox
        > expert editor with 7x7 array of speed/throttle/lock
V2.02.0 - added ECU speed stale, use ABS, confirmed TC flag (Bremse_1)
V2.03.0 - added speed at Bremse_3 and 'Restore Defaults' clearing onhaldex binary state Expert without refresh.  
V2.04.0 - added Force Mode (rather than fixing lock at 100% when TC active), changed Speed/Throttle/Lock Axis text
V2.05.0 - added Lock Target to Stock - this ensures that a % is achieved when TC/ExtBtn is enabled
V2.06.0 - added Haldex State in binary to better understand the state of the Haldex 
V2.07.0 - copied actual lock to requested lock in stock mode so it looks 'cleaner'
V2.10.0 - release
V2.10.1 - fixed the CAN health - always showed Unhealthy because it wasn't updating the flag

V3.00.0 - added support for Gen5 and Gen4 GM/SAAB Gen4 (but logged under 41 as in 4.1 since it's a variant of Gen4)
V3.00.1 - added 'Disable Onboard Button' and 'Disable External Button' options to allow disabling of the onboard button & added Learn Haldex function

V4.00.0 - added support for Gen41 dual-bus (late Insignia) - standalone frames, plus feedback decoding per GMW8762 PPEI
V4.00.1 - added low power mode to disable WiFi AP when no CAN traffic for 5+ minutes and no clients connected, to reduce power consumption when used in a parked car. WiFi restarts automatically when CAN traffic returns.
V4.00.2 - added Password Protection

V5.00.0 - added 'Fix Hunting' option to switch Motor_11 to BPK packing, which can help with hunting at partial lock on 554K controllers

V6.00.0 - added interrupt-based CAN handling, revised Hazard force mode handling, added LED brightness control, adjusted sleep configuration for low power mode 
V6.01.0 - added WiFi naming and better sleep configuration for low power mode, added 'Follow Hazard' force mode option, added 'Disable Hazard Force Mode' option to allow disabling of hazard force mode when the hazard switch is active, added 'Hazard Force Mode Source' option to select which CAN signal is used to trigger hazard force mode (Blinkmodi_02 vs GATEWAY_72)

V7.00.0 - added support for Gen5 (0AY) Haldex - a mix of Gen2 and Gen4 (but ultimately Gen5 chassis).

V8.00.0 - added support for Ford (based on example CAN data, totally untested!)
V8.00.1 - added fix for password and SSID change

V8.00.2 - added fix for TC/hazards not re-enabling stock mode

V8.00.3 - added drop-down options for adding/removing CAN signals if learn isn't 'clean'
        - when this was first developed the frames that 'changed' the Haldex response were ported to the non-standalone version
        - but there could be room for some 'additional'.  This allows the user to add additional frames to mirror standalone 
        - fixed bus recovery (would not recover...)
        - minor UI tweak so that force modes display better (single line)
        - added TP2.0 (ported from Can2Cluster) / VCDS logged (1K0 554C) - see /Documents/vehicle-logs
        - added new scaling for UDS - 0CQ 554C/D - heated on bench and logged with VCDS
        - minor lock tweaks on 0CQ to target 100% cleaner

** to do **:
        > add throttle/speed axis refresh
        > add 'ota' to match existing layout
        > add reduction in throttle/speed off
        > move CAN into interrupt based - ESP_INTR_FLAG_IRAM
